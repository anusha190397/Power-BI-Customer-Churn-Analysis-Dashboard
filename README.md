Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). The dashboard provides insights into customer churn patterns and helps identify factors and risks contributing to customer attrition.

Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers over time. Analyzing churn is crucial for businesses to understand why customers leave and to develop strategies to retain them. This project uses Power BI to visualize customer churn data and DAX to create meaningful metrics and insights.
